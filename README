NOT WORKING ATM --- I AM WORKING ON GETTING IT IMPORTED!!!

Guiki (Graphical Wiki)

Guiki is my attempt to scratch my own itch for a simple content management system.

It is very easy to install and use and does not have a lot of the fluff other wiki systems and content management systems include.

I am just getting started at github and my code has never been exposed via SCM so it is not pretty at the moment....

I will work on that...

Enjoy,
