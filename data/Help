<P><STRONG>I would love your help</STRONG></P>
<P>I would love for this to take off and have many people who are more talented than I am work on this to make it a much better system than it is now. I need a system like this to help me keep the information I have better organized and more presentable. That being my goal and hopfully yours I would love to see your changes to the system as well as your suggestions and ideas on how this could be improved.</P>
<P>If you have suggestions please send them to <A href=\"mailto:lankford@guiki.com\">lankford@guiki.com</A>&nbsp;. Please be aware that I always have people pushing me to get this and that done and that sometimes I am slow to respond to email. That being said also keep in mind that you may send an email, not get a response and check the [[Download]] page and find that your idea is in the new version and your name (please say if its ok in your mail) is added to the [[Credits]] page.</P>
