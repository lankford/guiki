<P><FONT face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\">I knew that I wanted to use </FONT><A href=\"http://www.interactivetools.com/products/htmlarea/\" target=blank><FONT face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\">HTMLArea</FONT></A><FONT face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\"> and that I did not want a lot of <EM>special </EM>things to remember just to edit the text. Because of this the main difference between </FONT><A href=\"http://www.guiki.com/\" target=_blank><FONT face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\">Guiki</FONT></A><FONT face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\"> and other Wiki software is that there is only one wiki command and that is the link/new page creation syntax. To put your page name in <EM>double square brackets </EM>creates a new link if it does not exist it will be created. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\">Since I have a lot of web sites that I work on and maintain and I do not have a need for the fancy I do not need nor want a full blown CMS (content management system) but rather something simple, themeable, that I can upgrade the software without having to re-do all of the data for the site. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=\"arial, helvetica, sans-serif\">I have made this flexible for my needs and the code is somewhat lacking in elegance but this will change over time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I wanted a way to keep information up to date that was easy for them to use. Guiki has done just that for me and my company and I thought that it may do the same for you.</FONT></P>
