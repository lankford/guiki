<FONT face=Arial>A wiki is a system that allows you to edit a web page using just a web browser. The best example for using a wiki that I know of is the </FONT><A href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/\" target=_blank><FONT face=Arial>WIKIPEDIA</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial>. I have long liked that idea but have never liked the way you had to edit the files with special markup language. After a long search for software that worked the way I wanted I have not found it. Because of this I decided to start hacking one together myself.</FONT>
