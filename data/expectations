<P><FONT face=Arial>From the server logs I see a lot of traffic from Linux / BSD boxs. I know that some of you are very disapointed when you try to edit and just see a plain old TEXTAREA. There is a version of HTMLArea that works with netscape and I too want that feature (Linux being my primary OS) But it is beta software. I have it working and&nbsp;you can use&nbsp;the HTMLArea&nbsp;theme that uses&nbsp;it but it just is not working very well yet. To do this just change the <STRONG><FONT color=#660000>$THEME = \"themes/HTMLArea3\";</FONT> </STRONG>in the config file.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>I am looking forward to the release of HTMLArea 3.0.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Arial>Also this is <STRONG>not</STRONG> a full featured wiki as the audience is more&nbsp;my internal users at my job that quite frankly could not understand the concept of wiki. (Full testing <STRONG>has</STRONG> been done on this)</FONT></P>
